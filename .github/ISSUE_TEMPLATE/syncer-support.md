2. Operation logs
    - [ ] please provide config file of syncer.
    - [ ] Please upload `syncer.log` if possible.
    - [ ] Please upload monitor screenshots. if not deployed, please add prometheus monitor and [grafana dashboard](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible/blob/master/scripts/syncer.json)
    - [ ] Other interesting logs

3. Common issues
    - [ ] Is the `worker-count` set to a reasonable value (suggest-32)?
    - [ ] Is the `batch` set to a reasonable value (suggest 100-1000)?
    - [ ] Is the downstream server MySQL and does not use the `utf8mb4` charset (syncer only allows the downstream server's charset to be `utf8mb4`)?
